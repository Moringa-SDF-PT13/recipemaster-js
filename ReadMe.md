Fill in short description

## Tools

This project has been built using:

1. HTML
2. CSS (Carbon Design System by IBM)
3. JavaScript

## Learning

The main things we will learn in this lecture include the following:

1. The DOM and its manipulation
2. Connect our JS app to the internet. (How to interact with websevers from our web application)
3. Working with File I/O.

### DOM (Document Object Model)

Usually created when a web page starts to load.

Document Object - HTML Page

DOM - programming interface for HTML (A set of tools / methods that can be used to interact with HTML, commonly through JS)

Every HTML element is considered a DOM object.

All HTML elements and attributes have programming methods

All HTML elements can react to browser Events.

#### JS Superpower

What can JS do for you in the DOM:

a. Can change all elements in a page. (access, add, remove, update contents)
b. "" all HTML attributes in a page. ""
c. "" all CSS styling in a page. ""
d. react to browser events
e. Create new browser events

### The Internet

Connection between computers across a network.

Server (Middleware) - Just a set of computer(s) that can receive and provide resources across a network / the internet. {Offer a great place to consolidate information}

Web != Internet -> System of interconnected resources (images, audio, video, PDF, html pages ...) accessed through the internet using browsers and transmission protocols (HTTP/s, WebSockets, gRPC, GraphQL)

API (Application Programming Interface) - Is a set of rules / contract that describes what and how can items/entites can be interacted with in a given system.
